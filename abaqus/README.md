# Design of UD Composite Generator

- **Vue.js** is used as the framework, as handling the DOM for all the user inputs, is something that is a pain with plain jquery.

- **D3.js**, and its extension **d3-quadtree** is used in the implementation of the random arrangement.

- **PapaParse** is used for CSV parsing.

- **THREE.js** is used for building the 3D model of the UD composite.

- **toxiclibs.js** is used for some of the geometrical requirements in the Square and Hex Packing arrangements.

- **FileSaver.js** is used for generating the script file for downloading.

- **alertify.js** is used for user feedback by displaying error messages.
